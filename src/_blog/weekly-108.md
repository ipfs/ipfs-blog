# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly!

A quick look back at what we accomplished together in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! üöÄ

## Thank you. We couldn‚Äôt do this without you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

What a long, strange trip the past few months have been. We are so grateful for every single contributor who took the time to submit issues, apply for grants, invent in a hackathon, participate in surveys, share a pull request, attend an event, or offer encouragement. Thank you for all you do to make our community a fantastic place to be.

## Jumping right into July

New quarter, new project! We kicked this one off with an introduction to the [IPFS Case Study Series](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-07-09-case-study-audius/)! Includes features on Fleek, Arbol, Audius, and more.

Libp2p and ResNetLab teamed up to ship a comprehensive, 61-page [evaluation report on Gossipsub](https://blog.ipfs.io/gossipsubv1.1-eval-report-and-security-audit/), in which you can learn how they approached the testing of Gossipsub v1.1, the setting in which tests were run, and detailed descriptions of the conclusions taken from the evaluation.

The [js-ipfs 0.48.0 release](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-07-20-js-ipfs-0-48/) included much better default connectivity, a smaller blockstore, a more intuitive API, and loads of new features and bugfixes.

This [content routing deep dive](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-07-20-dht-deep-dive/) from the 0.5 release covered everything you wanted to know about how DHTs work, and how we made the implementation used by IPFS faster and more resilient.

[ProtoSchool created new dweb courses](https://proto.school/#/tutorials?course=ipfs) from the many tutorials they offer. Peruse courses on IPFS, Filecoin, Multiformats, and more with updated content from the latest releases.

Oli Evans created a way to [pin your site to IPFS from a GitHub Action](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-github-action)! The action pins a directory to IPFS by using the ipfs-cluster-ctl command to pin it to a remote IPFS Cluster.

## And, another month, August

We announced [deprecation of the SECIO security transport](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-08-07-deprecating-secio/) in favor of the Noise security transport.

[Our August virtual meetup](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-08-14-ipfs-meetup-aug2020/) hosted talks from Unstoppable Domains, the builders of Koda the Robot Dog, Ceramic, and more.

The virtual hackathon, [HackFS wrapped up](https://hack.ethglobal.co/hackfs/showcase), showcasing 135+ projects built with IPFS and Filecoin.

The first-ever [Randomness Summit](https://randomness2020.com/) took place, addressing the state of randomness beacon research and deployment, and was a great success.

Yiannis Psaras shared the merits of content addressability in a world increasingly reliant on internet networks in [How content addressing can solve streaming challenges as networks are overloaded](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2020/how-content-addressing-can-solve-streaming-challenges-as-networks-are-overloaded/).

[Chromium announced support](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/4e8ed0cecce04c5c55dd84a09e4df0d0f11c660f) for: ‚Äúcabal‚Äù, ‚Äúdat‚Äù, ‚Äúdid‚Äù, ‚Äúdweb‚Äù, ‚Äúethereum‚Äù, ‚Äúhyper‚Äù, ‚Äúipfs‚Äù, ‚Äúipns‚Äù, and ‚Äússb‚Äù. Another step forward for browser support and webcompat!

The Filecoin team started hosting [a series of Master Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rknj2GqvJtg&feature=emb_logo) to demonstrate how to build on the Filecoin network. In the first session, Jimmy Lee highlighted how to integrate the Slate API with IPFS and Filecoin.

## Staying the course in September

Obsidian Systems began their efforts to [add support for IPFS to Nix](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-09-08-nix-ipfs-milestone-1/), a package manager (but at its heart a general-purpose build tool), so that build products can be persisted to and fetched from IPFS.

[js-ipfs officially reached version 0.50.0](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-09-14-js-ipfs-0-50/), adding the ability to share a node between multiple browser tabs and greatly improved pinning performance.

In September we had the creators of IPFS Recovery, a HackFS project, and an update from the go-ipfs maintainers speak at our [monthly virtual community meetup](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-09-18-ipfs-meetup-sep2020/).

Our pals at Peergos were awarded a ‚Ç¨200,000 grant by the [Next Generation Internet Program for Open Internet Renovation](https://peergos.org/posts/next-generation-internet) (NGI-POINTER).

[Chrome Beta extended their safelist](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/09/chrome-86-improved-focus-highlighting.html) distributed web schemes for registerProtocolHandler(). IPFS was included alongside cabal, dat, did, dweb, ethereum, hyper, ipns, and ssb.

The IPFS Web UI team shipped a whole host of [new features in v2.11.0](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/releases/tag/v2.11.0) to make your IPFS experience smooth, sleek, and chic.

The podcast [Proof of Usability](https://anchor.fm/z-herring/episodes/Protocols-are-the-ultimate-hyper-object---Talking-Design-Philosophy-w-Jessica-Schilling-and-Jim-Lee-ejnn3o/a-a37rllr) interviewed IPFS & Filecoin designers Jessica Schilling and Jimmy Lee.

You can now search all of the [podcasts available to stream on IPFS](https://pod.casts.io/ipfs), courtesy of Pod.casts.io and Andrew Nesbitt.

The latest iteration of [go-IPFS, v0.7.0](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-09-24-go-ipfs-0-7-0/), landed and with it, the deprecation of SECIO, updates to IPNS paths, and some important plugin build changes. üéâ

## Also new this quarter...

Michael Sena, from Ceramic, asked, what is [Identity Index](https://medium.com/@msena/what-is-identity-index-d3594b59633e)?

[Peergos released v0.3.0](https://peergos.org/posts/release-v0.3.0) landing improvements to the S3 datastore, and now you can test their alpha!

Fleek [introduced Space](https://blog.space.storage/posts/Introducing-Space), an open-source file storage, sharing, and collaboration platform built on the distributed web.

The OrbitDB community created [PowergateIO](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db-powergate-io), a bridge between OrbitDB and Powergate, which is a bridge between Filecoin and IPFS.

[Galacteek released v0.4.33](https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/tag/v0.4.33), which shipped a critical fix to their multi-platform browser for the distributed web

The Audius Project shipped some [sleek Audius API Docs](https://audiusproject.github.io/api-docs/#audius-api-docs).

Textile [released v1.0.0 of go-threads](https://github.com/textileio/go-threads/releases/tag/v1.0.00), a server-less p2p database built on libp2p.

[QuestNetwork introduced qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), an open-source, trustless, peer-to-peer cross-platform social network.

Equilibrium shipped an update on improving the integration of the [Rust IPFS client with Substrate](https://medium.com/equilibriumco/tech-preview-2-rust-ipfs-substrate-848b8a1afb26).

The [DAG JOSE](https://www.memoryandthought.me/golang,/ipfs/2020/09/04/dag-jose-project.html) project by Adam Good kicked off.
