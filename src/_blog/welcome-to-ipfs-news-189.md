## Protocol Labs and Igalia add IPFS Protocol Support to Chromium

![](../assets/ipfs-blog-header_-chromium-protocol-handlers-post.png)

In a major milestone, we‚Äôre excited to announce [**support for pre-defined custom protocol handlers in Chromium**](https://ipfs.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25473244c7d18b897f5a1ff6b&id=93fad387d0&e=c8385b3b0b)! You can now build Chromium, the open source browser code used for Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, and more, with support for ‚Äúipfs://‚Äù addresses by changing only a couple of lines of code.   
  
IPFS has gained support in several ways across various browsers. From extensions to different levels of built-in support in Brave and Opera, to experiments with mobile operating systems, the network looks much different than it did in 2019.

Learn more about why this is a key step toward browsers that can meet a far more diverse set of user needs while maintaining an interoperable core.

## **Brand New on IPFS ‚ú®**

1. The InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) spec has been [overhauled and expanded](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/main/ipns/IPNS.md)!
2. Jonathan Victor kicked off the [Gaming, Metaverse, and Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x2kWcl9V6M) track at IPFS Camp and talked about how developers can create long term value through gaming in the future.
3. Guardian is a policy engine that also uses Hedera & IPFS to create provenance chains for ESG assets. [Learn more on the IPFS Blog](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-11-10-guardian-ipfs-and-hedera/)!
4. [Learn more](https://blog.ipfs.tech/state-of-ipfs-in-js/) about the history of IPFS development in JS, decisions by some maintainers on what to do going forward, and ways you can help.

## **Around the ecosystem üåé**

A new blog on TL;DR dives into the [tokenomics behind Filecoin](https://medium.com/tldrfilecoin/filecoin-tokenomics-understanding-an-advancing-economy-ef319632ffa8) and explains how they help drive long-term demand for network resources. Unlike other storage networks, the Filecoin token is primarily concerned with incentivizing reliable services and facilitating the on-chain economy. 

Filecoin Saturn is an [open-source, community-run Content Delivery Network](https://strn.network/) (CDN) built on Filecoin. Because it is trustless, permissionless, and inclusive, anyone can run Saturn software, contribute to the network, and earn Filecoin.

Protocol Labs and Filecoin Foundation announced the launch of the [Decentralized Storage Alliance](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/introducing-the-decentralized-storage-alliance/), a first-of-its-kind, member-led industry organization to drive awareness and adoption of decentralized technologies, such as Filecoin, IPFS, and libp2p, and help enterprises in Web2 make the transition to Web3.

Protocol Labs is bringing web users across the globe more control and independence by advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. We are now a [member of the Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/about-internet-society/organization-members/stories/protocol-labs/), a global non-profit organization ‚Äúempowering people to keep the Internet a force for good.‚Äù

Technological advances have enabled mass surveillance at a scale unimagined even by "1984," George Orwell's dystopian novel published in 1949, but how do we fight against Orwellian Systems? Juan Benet and Max Tegmark discussed these issues in [Breakthroughs in Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5ZxcxS3o3k).

Filecoin Green launched [CO2.Storage](https://co2.storage/), a Web3 data storage solution that intends to enable transparency for carbon offsets and address traditional storage solutions for all types of digital environmental assets, including renewable energy credits.

If you care about P2P, libp2p and IPFS, then you care about the most important unsolved piece of protocol design in P2P Networks: NAT Hole Punching. [Learn more](https://discuss.libp2p.io/t/call-for-participation-nat-hole-punching-measurement-campaign/1690) about the NAT Hole Punching Measurement Campaign and [sign up to participate](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eXLNaJZIUOJtcRS-S0JmXiQuhfmBuAnWm6uueDJgn0w/viewform?edit_requested=true).
