Last week at Scaling Ethereum, Dietrich Ayala helped kick off the hackathon by presenting a talk on how IPFS is being used to scale Ethereum, the problems IPFS addresses, an introduction to the web3 stack, as well as a quick walkthrough of approaches and resources to use IPFS today. In case you missed the talk, [**catch up here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13rHbWCYNWA) and be sure to check out our [**recent blog post**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-04-14-scaling-ethereum/) that highlights where you can find us at Scaling Ethereum, the prizes that Protocol Labs is offering, as well as some videos that will help you get started.

The Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator is a full-time, fully remote program dedicated to startups building more open, interoperable, and programmable tools, infrastructure, and applications for the distributed and decentralized web. Tachyon supports projects that build on and bridge the [**IPFS**](https://ipfs.io/), [**Filecoin**](https://filecoin.io/), and [**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org/) communities and the tools, middleware, and applications. The next cohort will run June through August 2021, with 20 teams from around the globe provided funding, mentorship, benefits, and programming around business and blockchain-specific issues, culminating in a Demo Day and post-program fundraising support kicking off in September. [Applications are now open and close at midnight EST on May 9.](https://tachyon.submittable.com/submit/192229/filecoin-launchpad-accelerator-ii)
