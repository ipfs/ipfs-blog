Here’s what’s happening in the [**InterPlanetary File System**](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## Spring University Hackathons Roundup 

![](../assets/spring-university-hackathons.png)

Last month, the IPFS project partnered with two different universities to sponsor student-led and organized hackathons focused on introducing ground-breaking initiatives at both the global and local level.

[**Cal Hacks**](https://helloworld.calhacks.io/), a nonprofit organization composed of University of California, Berkeley students, held a global hackathon to unite the innovators, creators, and troublemakers of the world, called hello:world. The goal was to inspire students to build something out of this world in the following categories: sustainability, connectivity, education, or community and civic engagement.

Similarly, the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) also held [**CivHacks**](https://www.civhacks.com/), an annual hackathon focused on providing a welcoming, engaging and creative environment to support social good in tech culture, open to several categories including health, sustainability, student success, and civics. To learn more about the success of the event and the prize winners, [**check out our recent blog post**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-05-18-spring-hackathons/).

## Use Estuary Node to store and retrieve your data from the Filecoin Network

Estuary is a network node that bridges IPFS ⇆ Filecoin. Unlike other nodes, Estuary ensures your storage and retrieval goals match your own storage heuristics. Estuary uses automation to make Filecoin storage deals, restore IPFS pins with Filecoin retrieval deals, and repairs deals against reliable miners. The outcome is that there is a higher guarantee of on chain data, and a higher guarantee your data won't disappear from the internet. [**Jimmy Lee’s DoraHack presentation**](https://youtu.be/3hbtHcn0Piw?t=2460) was an early preview of what led up to our learnings, and the API and documentation we plan on releasing to the community. To contribute to the community discussion, [**see here**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/105).
