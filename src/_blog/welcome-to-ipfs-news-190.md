## **Content Addressed Computing**

![](../assets/ipfs-blog-header-cod-track-at-ipfs-camp.png)

In the Compute-Over-Data track at [IPFS Camp 2022](https://2022.ipfs.camp/), several projects and IPFS contributors highlighted [how the landscape of computing is evolving](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-12-01-cod-at-ipfs-camp/), and how they believe computing can become refocused and more powerful by embracing content addressing and a ‚Äúmerkle-native‚Äù way of doing things.   
  
Content-addressing and the use of merkle data structures‚Äì identifying data by a cryptographic hash ‚Äì is already a well-known revolution of how data structures can be designed for decentralization, bringing benefits like verifiability, naturally coordination-free data deduplication, and more. Learn more in [this recap](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-12-01-cod-at-ipfs-camp/) of the Compute-Over-Data track from IPFS Camp.
