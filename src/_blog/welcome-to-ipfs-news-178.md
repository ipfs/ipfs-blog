[The Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/) has started to use IPFS as its censorship-resistant storage solution for the data on its US Press Freedom Tracker. The database contains reports of press freedom violations over the past five years and makes them available through its API. IPFS will help to permanently store this valuable information in the interest of journalists, advocates, and policy makers. Find out more about how to peruse the data for yourself by reading the [announcement](https://freedom.press/news/us-pft-on-ipfs/).
