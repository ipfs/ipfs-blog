## **IPFS Project Roadmap v.0.6.0**

@[youtube](9rlPkY0HntE)

[Tune in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rlPkY0HntE) to Juan Benet’s in-depth look at what’s ahead for IPFS as it continues to make strides in providing the internet with a robust infrastructure for decentralized storage. In v0.6.0, the protocol will move closer toward the goal to be the default tool for distributing large files, promoting end-to-end encryption, and supporting the evolution of a self-archiving and decentralized web. Watch the full [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rlPkY0HntE) to learn more about what’s next for IPFS.
