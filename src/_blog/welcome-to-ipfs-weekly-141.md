Here’s what’s happening in the [**InterPlanetary File System**](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## OpenSea stores NFTs with IPFS and Filecoin

![](../assets/filecoin-ipfs-x-opensea.png)

Our friends at [**OpenSea**](https://opensea.io/) recently [**launched**](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/decentralizing-nft-metadata-on-opensea/) a feature to “freeze” NFT metadata, enabling NFT creators to properly decentralize their NFTs using IPFS and Filecoin. OpenSea is one of the largest NFT marketplaces in the web3 space, creating a market for millions of NFTs today. Using IPFS and Filecoin, NFT creators that use OpenSea can now create immutable NFT metadata using IPFS [**content addressing**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-04-05-storing-nfts-on-ipfs/) and [**provable and decentralized storage with Filecoin**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-06-03-ipfs-filecoin-content-persistence/).
