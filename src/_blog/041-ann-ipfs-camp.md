The Camp will bring together the Core Developers and Contributors to the IPFS project, Community Leaders, Builders on of the Distributed Web and you! The event will build on top of the successful IPFS Developer Meetings in Berlin last year and add a full immersive experience for its attendees and contributors.

Join us on 27-30th June at the beautiful Campus La Mola in Barcelona for an action-packed program of workshops, talks and deep dives on everything IPFS.
