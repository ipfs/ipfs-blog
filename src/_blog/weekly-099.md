## Quote of the week

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To truly own your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/data?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#data</a> I understand you need access and availability, does that mean you will basically own your private cloud with tools like <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPFS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IPFS</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/filecoins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#filecoins</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Filecoin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Filecoin</a> ? If so it seems to become a Great alternative to exisiting cloud storage systems like <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@awscloud</a></p>&mdash; Ronny Boesing (@BoesingRonny) <a href="https://twitter.com/BoesingRonny/status/1288057780449026048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2020</a></blockquote>
