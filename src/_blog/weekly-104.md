Here’s what’s happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## Join us Thursday for a community meetup

It’s September so it’s time for the IPFS community to gather once again! This month we’ll have guests from IoTeX, the folks behind Ucam, plus the creators of IPFS Recovery, an update from the go-IPFS maintainers, and more. Sign up to give a lightning talk and share what you’ve been building with IPFS!

[Register here](https://protocol.zoom.us/webinar/register/9815995835879/WN_BD2oTcusST6QrfOw3Dx8Qw)

## Chrome Beta added support for ipfs:// and ipns://

Hot on the heels of the news of Chromium’s support for dweb protocols (including ipfs://) comes the announcement that Chrome Beta extended their safelist distributed web schemes for <code>registerProtocolHandler()</code>. IPFS was included alongside <code>cabal, dat, did, dweb, ethereum, hyper, ipns, and ssb</code>.

## Interested in putting your IPFS project on Filecoin?

Calling all builders! We’re looking for as many IPFS projects as possible to integrate with Filecoin by September 18. Protocol Labs can potentially offer grants, as well as support from our engineering team and community, for large projects that can hit this timeline. Check out how to [deploy your app to the network](https://docs.filecoin.io/build/start-building/deploy-your-application-to-the-filecoin-testnet/) and tools like [Textile’s Powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/) that makes integration much easier. Reach out to ipfs-to-filecoin-testnet@protocol.ai if you are interested or have any questions.

## Brand new on IPFS

- [Read this proposal](https://hackernoon.com/what-would-git-could-look-like-in-web-30-xdt3wdx) for a distributed version control system that can be navigated via a block explorer.
- Create “art” on IPFS with [Nifty.Ink](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/nifty-ink-%EF%B8%8F-alpha-release-c860a4904cb2), built on scaffold-eth, an NFT platform that scales.
- The [DAG JOSE Project](https://www.memoryandthought.me/golang,/ipfs/2020/09/04/dag-jose-project.html), enabling interoperable encrypted and/or signed application data in IPFS via IPLD and JOSE.
- [What are your thoughts](https://talk.fission.codes/t/spa-mode-for-go-ipfs-http-gateway/999) on the folks at Fission creating a SPA mode for go-ipfs HTTP gateway?

## People are building the coolest things with IPFS

Check out [Parcel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=AVyNd994IFM&feature=emb_logo), a decentralized, crypto payroll service with built-in end-to-end data encryption using Sablier, Filecoin and IPFS.

Alfonso de la Rocha strikes again, this time with [Hash Array Mapped Tries (HAMT)](https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-hash-array-mapped-tries) to the rescue!

What’s the latest in [Berty news](https://berty.tech/newsletter/news-44/)?

Matthew Gould and Bradley Kam, of [Unstoppable Domains](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-boost-vc-podcast/ep95-how-dweb-outdoes-the-se4uUkTLOZ1/), talk about the future of dweb in the latest episode from The Boost VC Podcast.

Over 200 Graph Nodes were deployed in [The Graph’s Testnet](https://medium.com/graphprotocol/over-200-graph-nodes-deployed-in-the-graphs-testnet-1cec2175d15a)

This, we love: [Blockchain, Creativity and Arts Intertwine](https://medium.com/paradigm-fund/blockchain-creativity-and-arts-intertwine-d3c42739312f): Use Cases and Notable Projects

Projects using IPFS got some love as part of the Web3 Foundation Grants [Wave 6 Recipients](https://medium.com/web3foundation/web3-foundation-grants-wave-6-recipients-5ed8d5cc179).

## ETHGlobal’s biggest event of the year
