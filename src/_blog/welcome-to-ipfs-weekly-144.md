We're happy to announce [**the release of IPFS Cluster 0.14.0**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-07-12-ipfs-cluster-0-14-0/)! IPFS Cluster provides an overlay layer to control and orchestrate pinsets in multiple IPFS daemons. It adds content, distributes pins, tracks them, and ensures content is replicated while providing streamlined API(s) for IPFS storage management. From feedback received, the [**release of IPFS Cluster 0.14.0**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-07-12-ipfs-cluster-0-14-0/) has added CAR import support, batched-pin ingestion, and automatic garbage collection to the Badger datastore, along with other optimizations, updates, and bug fixes.

## Browsers 3000 kicks off its 6 week event, including a presentation from ENS

## Want to help build the new internet?

[**Senior Software Engineer**](https://jobs.lever.co/protocol/3490e571-4d47-487e-a47f-b02f08668290): Distributed systems engineering lies at the center of many projects at Protocol Labs. With IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin, and other related projects, we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, more secure, distributed version of the web. This requires rigorous engineering from protocol design through all the phases of implementation. We strike a balance between pragmatism (put it on a ship :ferry:), deeply informed protocol design, and strict application of strong engineering principles. All of this happens in an environment defined by curiosity, passion, and a love for open source. **Protocol Labs**, Remote.

[**Fullstack Engineer**](https://boards.greenhouse.io/textileio/jobs/4017984004): Textile's web products and services are written primarily in Golang and TypeScript, and communicate with Textile's core gRPC services.
