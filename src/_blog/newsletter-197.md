## **Introducing the Ecosystem Working Group 🔭**

Since its initial release over 9 years ago, IPFS has been stewarded by a variety of teams and individual contributors, both within and outside of Protocol Labs. More recently though, it has lacked a dedicated team focused on nothing other than the success of the IPFS ecosystem. It is with this reality in mind that we are excited to announce the formation of **[the brand new IPFS Ecosystem Working Group](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-introducing-the-ecosystem-working-group/)**!
