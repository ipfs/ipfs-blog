Next week, the IPFS team will be heading to Denver, Colorado for [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/), one of the biggest Ethereum and decentralized web developer-focused events in the US. We‚Äôre very excited to connect with the dweb community during a week full of presentations, workshops, [#BUIDLathon](https://www.ethdenver.com/buidlweek/)-ing, and community gathering.

On Thursday, February 13, the IPFS Community is hosting the [Distributed Networks Summit](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/distributed-networks-summit-ipfs-friends-tickets-86959928487?aff=protocollabs), featuring speakers and workshops from IPFS Core, Protocol Labs, Textile, ProtoSchool, 3Box, RTrade Technologies, Pinata, Althea, Quorum Control, Kauri, and more!

Think of it as our early Valentine‚Äôs Day gift from the IPFS community to you. üíù
