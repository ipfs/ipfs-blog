## **What are the Potential Benefits of IPFS over WebDAV?**

![](../assets/0003_v2.jpg)

WebDAV extends the HTTP protocol and enables web servers to also act as file servers. WebDAV extends the HTTP methods to their needs, and could potentially make IPFS easier to use. It even opens up new use cases, such as a writable gateway, IPFS integrations in apps currently supporting WebDAV, plus Android and iOS support.  
  
Learn more about [**IPFS over WebDAV**](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-10-13-ipfs-over-webdav/) and how you can help improve it!
