## **Snapshot IPFS Case Study**

![](../assets/cover-afade294.png)

Snapshot is an open-source voting platform for Web3 projects, DAOs, and communities that uses IPFS as its main storage layer. It is unique in its use of IPFS to store proposals and user votes using a technique known as ‚Äòoff-chain‚Äô voting, where the cryptographic signatures proving user votes are persisted to IPFS instead of being stored on the blockchain. Read this [case study](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-08-25-snapshot-ipfs-case-study/) to learn more about how this lowers the barriers to entry for community governance.
