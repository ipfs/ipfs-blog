## Decentralized Uniswap Interface Hosting on IPFS

![Crust x IPFS - Uniswap IPFS Integration](../assets/crust-ipfs.jpg)

Uniswap has merged the code to continuously deploy its interface on Crust Network! Hosting a website/DApp frontend on IPFS grants you several benefits, such as serverless hosting, potential resilience to DNS hijacks (together with IPNS/ENS), and high uptime. Uniswap, as one of the most widely used DEX‚Äôs (Decentralized Exchange), has been integrated with IPFS for approximately a year. [This article](https://medium.com/crustnetwork/decentralized-uniswap-interface-hosting-on-ipfs-18a78d1209ac) explains the whole process in more detail, and also describes how to host a website in a more decentralized way using Crust.
