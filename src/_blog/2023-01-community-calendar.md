## The IPFS community is growing

Over the last several years, the number of contributors, companies, and working groups advancing IPFS through specs, developer tooling, and implementations has grown significantly.

This reflects an important shift for the IPFS project â€” **IPFS is now driven by a thriving community** from all corners of the world.

This shift is evident on several fronts: the sheer number of working groups regularly meeting, the scope and breadth of new projects (expanding IPFS into compute with [Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/), and activity in the [IPFS specifications repo](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/) which has spiked in the last year.

## The New IPFS Community Calendar

Today, in the spirit of the new year, we're excited to share the new [IPFS Community Calendar](https://ipfs.fyi/calendar) as a hub for all IPFS community events â€” both offline and online.

We created this for you and are keen to have you join us.

## Events for everyone

The versatility of IPFS attracts a variety of community members such as application developers, game developers, low-level protocol developers, service providers, and artists and creatives.

The community calendar should serve as the event hub for all these different groups. We already have events covering a wide spectrum of levels and areas of interest to cater to both newcomers and long standing members of the community:

- [Compute over Data (COD) Working Group](https://lu.ma/codwg) - community of decentralized compute projects and related tooling meeting online every two weeks and in person twice a year to collaborate and raise awareness of our space.
- [InterPlantary Office Hours](https://lu.ma/IP-Office-Hours) - a weekly session open to all levels, where you can bring your IPFS questions.
- [IPFS Implementers Sync](https://lu.ma/ipfs-implementers) - a meeting for those creating and maintaining IPFS implementations to discuss the protocol, specs, and [IPIPs](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/main/IPIP_PROCESS.md).
- [IPFS Content Routing Working Group](https://lu.ma/ipfs-routing-wg) - a work group focused on content routing in IPFS the subsystem responsible for how content is discovered on the IPFS network.
- [IPVM Community Call](https://lu.ma/ipvm) - focused on the effort to add content-addressed computation with a virtual machine to IPFS.
- [IPFS Thing 2023](https://lu.ma/ipfsthing-preregistration) - an in-person event bringing together maintainers or core contributors of an IPFS implementation, ranging from production usage to working demo.
