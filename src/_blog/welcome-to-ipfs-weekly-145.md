Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the [**InterPlanetary File System**](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## Building Web3: Pinata

@[youtube](29k2C1JXyg4)

We‚Äôre excited to launch the latest video in the Building Web3 series, highlighting leading projects in the Web3 and decentralized storage ecosystems. [**Building Web3: Pinata**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29k2C1JXyg4) is a look at the [**Pinata**](https://pinata.cloud/) service and team. Today, Pinata builds tools and infrastructure that make it easy for Web3 developers to create and manage content on IPFS while also leading a charge in how the world stores, accesses, and verifies blockchain-linked content. One way in which all this comes together is the world of NFTs, where Pinata provides secure and verifiable file storage to considerably streamline the process of minting, selling, and transferring NFTs.

## A Brave New Wallet

Brave is a privacy-focused browser where you are not a product. A search engine that doesn‚Äôt track you. An opt-in ad economy that rewards you for browsing. A growing ecosystem of users. In January, Brave announced native support for IPFS directly in the browser. Next up for Brave: the Brave Wallet and the vision of a native crypto wallet for every internet user. During Browsers 3000, Brave engineer Anirudha Bose talked through the future of Brave Wallet and the Brave browser‚Äôs use of IPFS.
