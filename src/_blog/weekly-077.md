# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening lately in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! üöÄ

## Our focus for 2020: üìû Content Routing

Yesterday we released our roadmap for 2020 and more, in a post [examining our project focus for the coming year](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-10-our-focus-for-2020/).¬†Beginning with an excellent recap of 2019‚Äîincluding some of the year‚Äôs top wins‚Äîas well as describing the unenviable process of roadmapping and decisions that led to our chosen focus, you can read all this and more [on the IPFS blog](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-10-our-focus-for-2020/).

## Introducing the Interplanetary Testground

Last week, another project entered the Interplanetary realm: [Testground](https://github.com/ipfs/testground)! Though created by the helping hands of IPFS and friends, Testground is a general-purpose, agnostic platform for¬†testing distributed software at scale. Take a look at the [latest release notes](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/releases/tag/v0.1.0) and give it a try! üí´
