# IPLD 2025 Review

_Cross-posted from the [IPFS Foundation blog](https://ipfsfoundation.org/ipld-2025-in-review/)._

Whether you're building on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), or [ATProto](https://atproto.com/), [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) (InterPlanetary Linked Data) — a shared data model for the self-certifying, content-addressable web — ensures your data is portable and verifiable across platforms. This post covers the past year's progress in the IPLD ecosystem and a preview of what to expect in 2026, with a focus on Rust IPLD.

## Rust IPLD: From Monolith to Modules

Following the [JavaScript implementation's](https://ipld.io/libraries/javascript/) lead, we recognized that most projects only need specific IPLD components rather than the full stack. Earlier this year, we successfully migrated the `libipld` functionality into separate, focused crates and [officially deprecated](https://github.com/ipld/libipld/commit/6f0028519d60078f062b1fad403e2c783ce3fb2c) the Rust implementation [`libipld`](https://crates.io/crates/libipld). This modular architecture is now the standard across all IPLD implementations.

Over the past few months, we helped migrate all actively maintained projects that had updates in the past two years. Many projects had already made the switch on their own.

**Performance win:** Moving the Python [DAG-CBOR](https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-cbor/) library [`python-libipld`](https://github.com/MarshalX/python-libipld) to [`cbor4ii`](https://crates.io/crates/cbor4ii) and the latest [Rust `cid`](https://crates.io/crates/cid) version made [Bluesky custom feeds in Python ~2x faster](https://bsky.app/profile/marshal.dev/post/3m6wqrij2es2v).

## Migration Guide: What Replaces What

If you're a Rust developer still using `libipld`, here's your upgrade path:

### For IPLD Data Model work

**Use:** [`ipld-core`](https://crates.io/crates/ipld-core), which is similar to the deprecated [`libipld-core`](https://crates.io/crates/libipld-core).

### For encoding/decoding

**Old way:** Custom `libipld` traits for [DAG-CBOR](https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-cbor/), [DAG-JSON](https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-json/), and [DAG-PB](https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-pb/). [`libipld-cbor-derive`](https://crates.io/crates/libipld-cbor-derive) for IPLD Schema-like transformations.

**New way:** Serde-based crates that go directly from serialization to native Rust types without the IPLD Data Model conversion in between:

- [`serde_ipld_dagcbor`](https://crates.io/crates/serde_ipld_dagcbor/) for DAG-CBOR
- [`serde_ipld_dagjson`](https://crates.io/crates/serde_ipld_dagjson/) for DAG-JSON
- [`ipld-dagpb`](https://crates.io/crates/ipld-dagpb) for DAG-PB (not Serde-based since DAG-PB doesn't support the full IPLD Data Model)

[IPLD Schema-like transformations](https://ipld.io/docs/schemas/features/representation-strategies/) can now be done directly with [Serde attributes](https://serde.rs/attributes.html).

**Adoption in the wild:** `serde_ipld_dagcbor` is now widely used in the Rust ATProto community, including [rsky](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky) (AT Protocol implementation in Rust), [ATrium](https://github.com/atrium-rs/atrium), and [jacquard](https://tangled.org/nonbinary.computer/jacquard) (ATProto/Bluesky libraries).

## IPLD Schemas

[@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg/) made a [big upgrade to the code generation of IPLD Schemas](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-schema/pull/135). When you define a schema, you can now generate code for Go, Rust, and TypeScript.

## Multiformats

The Rust [multiformats](https://multiformats.io/) implementations are under active maintenance and all actionable items on [`cid`](https://crates.io/crates/cid), [`multihash`](https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multihash), and [`multibase`](https://crates.io/crates/multibase) have been resolved.

Rust multiformats now joins Go and JS in being stable and production-ready, and you can expect mostly minor dependency updates in 2026.

## DASL: Starting Simple, Staying Compatible

Not every project needs IPLD's full flexibility. [DASL (Data Addressable Structures and Links)](https://dasl.ing/) offers a streamlined subset: fewer decisions, fewer dependencies, easier to implement. We worked to ensure the DASL specifications remained a strict subset of IPLD, so data created with DASL tools remain seamlessly compatible with the broader IPLD ecosystem.

## Thank You

Special thanks to [@Stebalien](https://github.com/Stebalien/) and [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg/) for their countless hours helping maintain various IPLD and multiformats libraries.
