## **Functionland: Using IPFS to Enable Free-to-Use Cloud Applications**

![](../assets/ipfs-feb-16.png)

Truly free-to-use applications are a rarity in the Web 2.0 world because users are always paying with money, data, or attention. [**Functionland**](https://fx.land/)’s Fula Network is a Web3 alternative to this model. It’s a privacy-focused, user-powered platform that enables free-to-use applications and services by rewarding users for sharing storage and computer resources. At the same time, it compensates open-source developers for providing applications and services. Functionland chose IPFS to implement a decentralized take on the client-server model. [**Learn more**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2022-02-22-functionland/) about how it uses dedicated hardware to achieve this.
