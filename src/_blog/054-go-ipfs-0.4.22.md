**We've released a PATCH version of go-ipfs based on 0.4.21 containing some critical fixes.**

The IPFS network has scaled to the point where small changes can have a wide-reaching impact on the entire network. To keep this situation from escalating, we've put a hold on releasing new features until we can improve our [release process](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/releases.md) (which we've trialed in this release) and [testing procedures](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6483).

You can read more about the new release process in the [release process blog post](/blog/2019-08-14-ipfs-release-process/).

This release includes fixes for the following regressions:

1. A major bitswap throughput regression introduced in 0.4.21 ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6442](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6442)).
2. High bitswap CPU usage when connected to many (e.g. 10,000) peers. See [ipfs/go-bitswap#154](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/154).
3. The local network discovery service sometimes initializes before the networking module, causing it to announce the wrong addresses and sometimes complain about not being able to determine the IP address ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6415](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6415)).

It also includes fixes for:

1. Pins not being persisted after `ipfs block add --pin` ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6441](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6441)).
2. Panic due to concurrent map access when adding and listing pins at the same time ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6419](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6419)).
3. Potential pin-set corruption given a concurrent `ipfs repo gc` and `ipfs pin rm` ([ipfs/go-ipfs#6444](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6444)).
4. Build failure due to a deleted git tag in one of our dependencies ([ipfs/go-ds-badger#64](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-badger/pull/65)).

Thanks to:
