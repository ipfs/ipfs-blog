Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy! üöÄ

## go-ipfs 0.7 is here üöÄüöÄüöÄ

The latest iteration of the Go implementation of IPFS brings a truckload of features and fixes: SECIO disabled by default üëã, rotating keys üîë, IPNS paths now encode the key name as a base36 CIDv1 by default üéπ, key export/import üì¶, and more. Great work everyone!

## Case Study: Shipping IPFS with Morpheus.Network

And we mean that quite literally. For Morpheus.Network, shipping of goods across the globe, it‚Äôs critical‚Äîboth functionally and legally‚Äîto have verifiable, consistently accessible documentation for every shipment. That‚Äôs where IPFS comes into the picture, in the latest entry in the IPFS Case Study series.
