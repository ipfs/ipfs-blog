## The latest on IPFS Mobile Design Research

For IPFS to succeed, it needs to be where people will use it, and for the vast majority around the world that is on their smartphones. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve teamed up with Jim Kosem to understand how people are building, using and thinking about P2P and IPFS on mobile today in order to create tools and guidelines. [In his latest post for the IPFS blog](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-04-24-ipfs-mobile-design-research-findings/), Jim shares a summary of his findings.
