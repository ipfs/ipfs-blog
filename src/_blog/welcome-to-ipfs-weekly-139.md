Here’s what’s happening in the [**InterPlanetary File System**](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## IPFS, Filecoin, and Content Persistence

![](../assets/ipfs-fil-blog-persistence-art.png)

There are two fundamental problems facing the sustainability of content on the internet: addressing and persistence. _Addressing_ refers to the way in which internet users can find the content that they’re looking for online. Today, the Web leans into location addressing, or finding content by where it is located, as opposed to content addressing, which allows network participants to confidently and consistently ensure their content does not change over time without a clear record of that change. _Persistence_ refers to the ability of those network participants to continue accessing content in perpetuity, without worries of the content disappearing or becoming unavailable for any reason.

## DI2F: Decentralizing the Internet with IPFS and Filecoin

![](../assets/di2f-cover-slide.png)

The first edition of a research-focused workshop on decentralisation, IPFS and Filecoin is here! DI2F is taking place alongside IFIP Networking 2021 on June 21, 2021 and it has a packed program full of exciting paper presentations, demos, abstracts, hands-on tutorials and invited talks! The workshop sessions will focus on protocol and architecture extensions, Decentralized Identity and Web 3.0 services.

The workshop’s hands-on session will get the audience kickstarted with the IPFS essentials and a hackathon will kick off at the end of the day and run for the following three weeks, netting the finalists prizes of more than $1,000.

The workshop will run from 13:00-18:30pm UTC+3 on June 21st.
