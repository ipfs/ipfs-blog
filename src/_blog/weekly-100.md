# Welcome to IPFS Weekly #100

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy! üöÄ

## üö® We are deprecating SECIO very soon üö®

Soon, support for the SECIO security transport in IPFS and libp2p will be removed. You can mitigate impact to your node(s) by updating to the latest versions.

- [Introducing Space](https://blog.space.storage/posts/Introducing-Space), an open-source file storage, sharing and collaboration platform for the dweb, from Fleek.
- [Testground v0.5.3](https://github.com/testground/testground/releases/tag/v0.5.3) adds support for traffic routing policies, basic authentication support, and more.
- [The React Roundup podcast](https://devchat.tv/react-round-up/rru-114-decentralized-react-threadsdb-ipfs-filecoin-with-carson-farmer/) had Carson Farmer from Textile on to talk ThreadsDB, IPFS, and more.

## New IPFS case study: OpenBazaar

The second in the IPFS Case Study Series focuses on OpenBazaar, a p2p e-commerce platform where buyers and sellers can participate anonymously and privately. By using IPFS to create this collaborative network, OpenBazaar enables users to trade without the risks of centralized data collection or the threat of having their personal information hacked!
