![](../assets/ipfs-2022-03-24.png)

Developers looking to build on the Web3 stack have a low-code solution that allows them to host their dapps, websites, and frontends using decentralized infrastructure. Fleek orchestrates services like IPFS, Filecoin, and ENS to provide a viable alternative to Web 2.0 counterparts like AWS, and DNS.
