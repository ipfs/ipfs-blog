Here’s what’s happening in the [**InterPlanetary File System**](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## Starling Lab: Establishing Trust for Humanity’s Data

![](../assets/starling-lab2.png)

Announcing the launch of Starling Lab, a commitment to continue building the frameworks required to endow humanity’s most vital digital information with trust. In collaboration with the USC Shoah Foundation and Stanford University, Starling Lab is deploying technology and methods that make the decentralized internet a viable platform for social impact. With an initial commitment of $2 million in funding from Protocol Labs and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web, the Starling Lab is the first center in the world dedicated to using decentralized tools to advance human rights.

Core to the Starling Lab solution is the Starling Framework, a set of open-source prototypes, best practices, and case studies built upon IPFS and Filecoin that help to reduce information uncertainty in digital media. The Starling Framework rests on the fundamental need to capture, store, and verify information to protect its integrity.

## Web3 Weekend in Review

![](../assets/2021-06-08-cardheader-web3weekend.png)

What better way to dive into all things Web3 than a weekend hackathon? The folks at ETHGlobal thought so, and we joined them during the last weekend in May for [**Web3 Weekend**](https://web3.ethglobal.co/).

This three-day event kicked off with a full-day summit, bringing together experts and luminaries from across the ecosystem to encourage and inspire builders to challenge the idea of what’s possible with decentralized technologies. Over the weekend, we offered a combined $20,000 Filecoin (FIL) prize pool distributed evenly between all submissions built on or with IPFS or Filecoin during Web3 Weekend. Any project built with ecosystem tools like Textile, Pinata, Fleek, Ceramic, Fission, Livepeer, and more received a prize—over 65 finalists in total! [**Check out this post**](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-06-08-web3-weekend/) for a full recap including challenges and finalists, as well as Protocol Labs’ talks and workshops from the event.
