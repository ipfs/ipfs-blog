IPFS Camp 2024 is back this summer and will take place on July 11-13 in Brussels, Belgium alongside EthCC. It is a three-day event filled with workshops, discussion circles, hacking time, and more — all focused on connecting builders and users in the hopes of making the internet more open, efficient, and secure.

To give you a taste of what kinds of topics the event will cover this year, we’re excited to share the 2024 track list below. If any of the tracks sparks your imagination or gives you an idea for something you’d like to present, be sure to submit a proposal for a talk. We’d love to hear from you!
