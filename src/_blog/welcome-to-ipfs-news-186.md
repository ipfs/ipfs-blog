## **Breaking Free from the Client-Server Model with IPFS**

![](../assets/ipfs-blog-header_-ipfs-camp.png)

Today, only a few companies are responsible for serving up most of the web. These companies combined serve us all our ads, web pages, social media, videos, images, and allow us to host servers and services on their proprietary infrastructures. This is because the web has been built under a client-server model that is quickly losing favor among users and developers alike. IPFS is part of a new wave of protocols and infrastructure solutions that are building the distributed web. Find out more about how content addressing and decentralized storage are essential to this future on the [IPFS blog](https://blog.ipfs.tech/ipfs-breaking-free-client-server/).

## **Brand New on IPFS ✨**

1. The new [Kubo v0.16.0](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/tag/v0.16.0) is now live. The release supports a more configurable delegated routing system with [Reframe protocol](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/main/reframe#readme). [See for yourself](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/tag/v0.16.0).
2. The IPFS GUI working group is looking to improve the experience on the [Public Gateway Checker](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/). [Book some time](http://calendly/) to let us know your thoughts and get a swag redemption code.
3. [Fission](https://fission.codes/) added a new feature to its SDK called WalletAuth that enables IPFS encrypted storage for any blockchain account. Learn more in this [thread](https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1573092516873781248).
4. Check out [Capyloon](https://capyloon.org/), a web-based smartphone OS with a built-in IPFS Rust implementation.
