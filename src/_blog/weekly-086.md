# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening lately in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! üöÄ

## The IPFS Mobile Design Research project

The IPFS Mobile Design Research project started earlier this year, and recently Jim Kosem presented the goals, methodology and findings of his in-progress research into IPFS and p2p on mobile. Check out [the blog post](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-04-10-ipfs-mobile-design-research/) and [the Local Offline Collaboration recording](https://youtu.be/Cg92MJY8swc?t=435) for more information.

## Announcing the IPFS Pinning Summit

On May 7-8, 2020, we are hosting the first-ever [IPFS Pinning Summit](https://ipfspinningsummit.com/), and we would love for you to attend! This virtual event is geared toward groups that provide pinning or other web/dweb infrastructure services. We plan to discuss the current state of distributed web infrastructure‚Äîincluding some of the challenges and operational lessons‚Äîand several exciting future opportunities (grants, integrations, potential new markets, etc). [Register to attend here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ipfs-pinning-summit-registration-102720606098).

## Introducing the IPFS Grants Platform

Earlier this week, the [IPFS Grants Platform was officially launched](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-04-20-ipfs-grants-platform/). After a very successful pilot run in Q1, we are very excited to offer a platform for grants that help support and accelerate the ecosystem of developers building on IPFS, and contribute to our mission to create a resilient, upgradeable, open network to preserve and grow humanity‚Äôs knowledge.
