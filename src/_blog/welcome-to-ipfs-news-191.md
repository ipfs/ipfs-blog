## **IPFS to Launch Into Space**

![](../assets/1-r0chmfcopebcnhpocykdpw-2.png)

The Filecoin Foundation [**announced**](https://twitter.com/IPFS/status/1616110027261227009?s=20&t=fv3FslvX-vH59U0lkAn4nw) a first-of-its-kind mission to [**send IPFS into space**](https://fil.org/blog/ff-x-lockheed-martin-mission-announcement/) in 2023. The mission will happen aboard Lockheed Martin’s LM 400 Technology Demonstrator spacecraft, a “software-defined satellite” that is created to support numerous missions. After the spacecraft is in orbit, it will use its “SmartSat™ software-defined satellite technology to upload and perform the IPFS demonstration.” This mission will showcase how IPFS uses content addressing to speed up data transfer across long distances.
