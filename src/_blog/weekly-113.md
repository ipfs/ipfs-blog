## IPFS featured on the Whiteboard Series with NEAR

The Whiteboard Series with NEAR is a set of video interviews with creators who are building scalable solutions for blockchain, and in their most recent episode, they interviewed IPFS software engineer Adin Schmahmann. As one of the foremost go-IPFS maintainers, Schmahmann takes the NEAR Protocol audience on a deep dive, including what‚Äôs next for IPFS and how it is helping the Web3 ecosystem.
