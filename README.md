## Usage

TK (dependencies etc)

**Run the site in dev mode**

```bash
$ instructions TK
...

Web Server is available at http://localhost:8080/
```

**Build the production site**

```bash
$ instructions TK

...

Site built out to ./dist dir
```

This will build out the static site, optimized and ready for deployment, to the `./dist` directory.

## Create a new blog post

Forestry instructions TK, including info on metadata, tags, custom header image, and other best practices

## Canonical tag list

### Editing

Submit a Github PR with your changes, and request a review.

1. Make a change to a file
2. Add and commit.
3. Push to a remote branch.
4. Make a pull request to `master`.
5. Request a review from another member of the IPFS org.

### Publishing

Most publishing activities can take place in Forestry, but ...

CircleCI builds the static site, pins it to our IPFS Cluster, and provides a preview link for a review on the gateway. Merges to to `master` do the same steps plus update the DNSLink for the domain.

In order for CircleCI to build the site after your merge, you _must_ be a member of the [website-deployers](https://github.com/orgs/ipfs/teams/website-deployers/members), comms, GUI or admin teams on the IPFS GitHub org and you _must_ subscribe to the CircleCI builds for the ipfs/blog repository. Create a free CircleCI account, and then [subscribe to the repo here](https://circleci.com/gh/ipfs/workflows/blog/tree/master).

After the CircleCI build completes, it will take a few minutes for the DNS update to propagate and your changes to show up on the website.

### Translating üåê‚úçÔ∏è

**To be replaced with VuePress-accurate translation instructions**
Every post can be optionally translated by:

1. Ensuring `config.toml` includes relevant [language code](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-language-codes) in `[languages]` section
2. Adding a translation file with correct locale suffix, for example:

   - English: `content/post/45-ipfs-weekly-11.md` ‚Üí //blog.ipfs.io/45-ipfs-weekly-11/
   - Chinese (Simplified): `content-i18n/<lang_code>/post/45-ipfs-weekly-11.md` ‚Üí //blog.ipfs.io/**zh-cn**/45-ipfs-weekly-11/

   Note: To ensure the translation is grouped with source post the `translationKey` header needs to be the same in both files, and `url` of translation needs to be prefixed with locale code (`zh-cn` for Chinese Simplified), for example:

   ```markdown
   ---
   date: 2018-09-25
   title: IPFS Âë®Êä•-11
   permalink: /zh-cn/45-ipfs-weekly-11/
   translationKey: 45-ipfs-weekly-11
   ---
   ```

Having that, non-english version will have unique URL, as seen on the example below:

| Chinese (Simplified)                                                                                      | English                                                                                                      |
